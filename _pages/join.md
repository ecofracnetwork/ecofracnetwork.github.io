# How to get involved

Joining our network is easy - just email [just email Will Pearse and ask to join](mailto:will.pearse@imperial.ac.uk) and we'll add you to our mailing list of interested participants. Once you've joined, the fun bit begins - collecting data!

Right now, we have the prototypes of all our sampling protocols in [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1C2mjuh-kftlMhfzv2RfKRYQgWoH5fc3W?usp=sharing). We also have a [one-page PDF that goes over the rationale and overall sampling aims of the scheme here](https://ecofracnetwork.github.io/images/EcoFracNet-onepage.pdf).
